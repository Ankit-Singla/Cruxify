# Cruxify
Chrome Extension

Cruxify your documents.
Read. Copy. Repeat. Download.

Cruxify is a chrome extension which is intended for a user to be able to save the "Crux" of a text (Article, Document, Blog post, etc.) in a file and download it without much effort. The user just needs to copy the pieces of texts that he/she wants to add to the crux, and Cruxify does the job of accumulating these copied pieces of texts into a file. The crux can be accessed and edited through the extension popup, which also provides a download button to save the crux as a text file on the local storage.
Simple as that, "Cruxify" enables users to store the gist/crux of a document to a local file effortlessly!
