# Cruxify
Chrome Extension

Cruxify is a chrome extension which is intended for a user to be able to save the "Crux" of a text (Article, Document, Blog post, etc.) in a file and download it without efforts. The user just needs to copy the pieces of texts that he/she wants to add to the crux, and Cruxify does the job of accumulating these copied pieces of texts into a file. When the user is done, he/she just needs to click the extension button to open the popup and click the "Download" button to save the file to the local file system.
Simple as that, "Cruxify" enables users to store the gist/crux of a document to a local file effortlessly!
